# TCORE Architecture

## Overview
TCORE is designed with a modular architecture that enables high performance and scalability. The main components include the processor core, memory management unit, and pipeline structure.

## Key Components
- **Processor Core**: The core design features a RISC-V compatible architecture with optimizations for power efficiency and performance.
- **Pipeline**: TCORE uses a 5-stage pipeline that allows for parallel instruction execution.
- **Memory Management Unit**: Handles memory access and virtual memory support.
