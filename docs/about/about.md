# About the Author

Welcome! My name is **Kerim Turak**, an Electrical and Electronics Engineer specializing in **embedded systems**, **computer architecture**, and **RISC-V processor design**. I am passionate about designing efficient, innovative systems and contributing to open-source projects that push the boundaries of technology.

## Professional Highlights:
- **Expertise in RISC-V Architecture**: Designing parametric memory systems and custom extensions for embedded applications.
- **RTL Design and Verification**: Proficient in SystemVerilog and Verilog HDL, focusing on performance-optimized and modular hardware design.
- **Software Skills**: Hands-on experience with Python, C, C++, and MATLAB for algorithm development and hardware-software integration.
- **Open-Source Advocate**: Actively contributing to and maintaining repositories for collaborative development.

## Current Focus:
I am currently developing **TCore**, a fully parametric RISC-V RV32IMC processor core designed to address modern challenges in processor design while remaining adaptable for future innovations. My work involves integrating advanced features like dynamic branch prediction and compressed instruction support.
